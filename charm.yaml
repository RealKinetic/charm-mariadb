  MariaDB is a community-developed fork of the MySQL relational database
  management system intended to remain free under the GNU GPL. Being a fork of
  a leading open source software system, it is notable for being led by the
  original developers of MySQL, who forked it due to concerns over its
  acquisition by Oracle. Contributors are required to share their copyright
